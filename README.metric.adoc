= Integrating Application Monitoring

This document outlines the steps required to configure an application to send metric data to your Docker monitoring stack, which includes Prometheus for metric storage and Grafana for visualization.

== Prerequisites

* Your application should expose metrics in a format that Prometheus can scrape (e.g., the Prometheus exposition format).

== Overview

Your monitoring stack utilizes Prometheus to scrape endpoint and store metrics. Applications need to expose an endpoint metrics in a format that Prometheus can scrape.

== Configuration Steps

=== Application Instrumentation

.  **Implement a Prometheus Metrics Endpoint:**
Your application must expose an HTTP endpoint that returns metrics in the Prometheus exposition format. +
This involves:
* Using a Prometheus client library for your programming language.
* Defining the metrics you want to collect (counters, gauges, histograms, etc.).
* Exposing these metrics via an HTTP endpoint (typically `/metrics`).
.  **Ensure your external service is connected to this network:**
+
[source,yaml]
----
# In your external service's docker-compose.yml
services:
  my-external-service:
    image: example.org/my-external-service
    networks:
      - docker-monitoring_public
networks:
  docker-monitoring_public:
    external: true
----

.  **Configure the scrape settings for your service:**
+
[source,yaml]
----
# config/prometheus/external_service/my-external-service.yml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: "my-external-service"
    scrape_interval: 30s
    scrape_timeout: 10s
    static_configs:
      - targets: ["my-external-service.docker-monitoring_public:9100"]
----
+
The target format follows the Docker DNS pattern:
+
[quote]
----
[container-name].docker-monitoring_public:[port]]
----
+
You can find the exact name of your container with the command:
+
[source,bash]
----
docker ps --format '{{.Names}}'
----
.  **Restart Prometheus to load the new configuration:**
+
[source,bash]
----
docker compose restart prometheus
----

== Troubleshooting

* **Connectivity Issues**
. Verify network connectivity:
+
[source,bash]
----
docker run --rm --network docker-monitoring_public alpine ping my-external-service.docker-monitoring_public
----

. Check if the metrics endpoint is accessible:
+
[source,bash]
----
docker run --rm --network docker-monitoring_public alpine/curl -v my-external-service.docker-monitoring_public:9100/metrics
----
